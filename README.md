# 📘 Data Cleaning Exercise: Standardizing Phone Numbers

## 📍 Overview
In real-world datasets, information often comes in **inconsistent formats**. This can cause major issues when analyzing, joining, or validating data.  
One common example is **phone numbers**:  
- `(905) 123-4567`  
- `289.234.5678`  
- `+1 4164567890`  
- `365 567 8901`  

All of these may represent the same structure, but unless standardized, they will be treated as different values in analysis.

This exercise uses a small dataset of customers contact information, where each phone number is deliberately written in a different style. Your goal is to **standardize** these phone numbers.
